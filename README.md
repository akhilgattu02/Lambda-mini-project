# Lambda-mini-project

1)This project is based on geolocation API of the web browser. 
2)The web-app enables you to monitor your workout activities and collects them in your browser storage. 
3)Once you give access to your browser to access your location, it loads your location and displays it as a map using "open-street" maps.
4)When you click on the map, a form shows up and after filling your workout activity(Running/Cycling), the information is displayed on the left hand side as logs and the location of the clicked area on map is marked/pinned with the information.
5)On clicking the logs on the left hand side, you can move to the appropriate location on the map, making it easy to monitor your workout activities.


# Documentation:
